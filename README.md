# Snaze

## Description


## How to compile
To compile we will use a makefile, so all compilations be more dynamic and automatic.
```bash
# To compile the whole project, insert 'make':
$ make

# To clean up all remaining trahsh data and files, such as the binary ones, insert 'make clean':
$ make clean
```

## How to execute
Now, we show how to run the program
```bash
# To compile:
make

# To execute program:
$ ./snaze data/boards

# Detail: The program will also show the possible errors.
```
